# SCheck Windsurf Agent Configuration

## Project Context
You are working on SCheck, a Flutter health tracking app built with Clean Architecture, BLoC, and dependency injection.

## Primary Directives
1. **Always follow Clean Architecture principles** - never cross layer boundaries
2. **Use BLoC for state management** - never use setState
3. **Generate code after schema/model changes** - run build_runner
4. **Write tests for all business logic** - use mocktail for mocking
5. **Follow the established patterns** - don't introduce new architectures

## Critical Rules
- **NEVER** access data layer directly from presentation
- **ALWAYS** use dependency injection with @injectable
- **ALWAYS** use freezed for events and states
- **NEVER** hardcode strings - use localization
- **ALWAYS** handle errors properly in BLoCs
- **NEVER** skip running code generation after changes

## File Structure Compliance
```
features/[feature]/
├── data/          # Only data sources, models, repository implementations
├── domain/        # Only entities, repository interfaces, use cases
└── presentation/  # Only UI, BLoCs, pages
```

## Required Commands After Changes
```bash
# After any freezed/injectable/schema changes
flutter packages pub run build_runner build

# After localization changes
flutter gen-l10n --arb-dir="lib/l10n/arb"
```

## Code Style Enforcement
- Use very_good_analysis linting
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add proper documentation
- Include error handling

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all use cases
- BLoC tests for state management
- Widget tests for UI components
- Mock all dependencies

## Security & Performance
- Never hardcode sensitive data
- Use const constructors
- Optimize for mobile performance
- Handle memory properly

## Before Submitting Code
- [ ] Code generation completed successfully
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Localization strings added
- [ ] Architecture boundaries respected
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Documentation updated
